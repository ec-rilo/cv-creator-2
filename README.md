## Features
This app generates a simple resume, collecting basic information such as your contact information, an image of yourself,
work experience, education, and skills.

## Motivation and Story
With this project I dove deep into the concepts of props and state with react. Finding creative ways to use them
with as minimal use of the JavaScript equivalent as possible. Having used concepts like raising state and passing props
to other components in order to update data while also dynamically creating and removing components throughout the project
I now have a solid concept of how to use them! I also wanted to challenge myself in using react-testing-library which
can be found sprinkled into the project.

All components were created using functional components.

## Code Styles
This project follows the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Eslint and Prettier were also used in this project.
