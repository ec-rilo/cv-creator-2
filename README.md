## Motivation and Story
With this project I dove deep into the concepts of props and state with react. Finding creative ways to use them
with as minimal use of the JavaScript equivalent as possible. Having used concepts like raising state and passing props
to other components in order to update data while also dynamically creating and removing components throughout the project
I now have a solid concept of how to use them! I also wanted to challenge myself in using react-testing-library which
can be found sprinkled into the project!

## Code Styles

## Credits
I'd like to thank the my small community on discord for always supporting my small milestones announcements for this project
